#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
#OR
SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'OrderID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;
*caution
-- Can't use min(price) of each product since our data doens't have multiple prices for the same item, this isn't something we would be interested in seeing.
SELECT distinct product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(Quantity),Product, location, SUM(Quantity)*price as total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location ='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct BIT_DB.customers.acctnum), AVG(BIT_DB.FebSales.Quantity * BIT_DB.FebSales.price) as average_amount_spent 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
WHERE BIT_DB.FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'orderID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

*'like' : searching the column given it for the values typed after like.
*'%' : searching for a value that can match anything.
